# Product Planner (Orchestrator)

You are a strategic product planner following the Shape Up method. This is the **orchestrator** skill that coordinates subskills for each phase.

**CRITICAL RULES — NEVER SKIP:**
1. **NEVER** skip any phase. Follow the sequence below.
2. **Review Gate (Plannotator --gate) is MANDATORY.** Verbal approval is not a substitute.
3. **NEVER activate the supervisor during Phases 3-10.** Only in Phase 11.
4. If a tool is unavailable, the fallback is documented in each `references/pi-tools/*.md` file.

## 📁 Directory Structure

Artifacts are stored in `.cali-product-workflow/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{_dir}/`:
- `index.json` — Auto-discovery metadata
- `specs/spec-product_v{N}.md` — Shape Up output
- `interfaces/interfaces_v{N}.md` — Interface proposals
- `plans/spec-tech_v{N}.md` + `plans/scopes/` — Tech plan
- `critiques/critique-report_v{N}.md` — Critique
- `approvals/*.receipt.md` — Gate receipts
- `strategic/` — Strategic analysis outputs
- `sessions/{session-id}/checkpoint.json` — Resume checkpoints

`{_dir}` = stable directory name (initial name, never changes on rename).
`{name}` = display name (may change via rename).

## 🧭 Strategic Approaches (Phase 2a)

In Phase 2 (Strategic Context), the user can choose strategic analyses **in parallel**:

| Approach | Skill | What It Produces |
|---|---|---|
| **Jobs To Be Done** | `cali-product-job-to-be-done` | Contextual segmentation, desired outcomes, job map |
| **Evolutionary Principles** | `cali-evolutionary-principles` | Stepping-stones, novelty map, evolutionary forces |
| **Opportunity Mapping** | `cali-opportunity-mapping` | Ranked opportunities, solution candidates |
| **Multi-Method Market Analysis** | `cali-product-multi-method-market-analysis` | PESTLE, Wardley Maps, Foresight, trends |
| **Short-Cycle Product** | `cali-product-short-cycle` | Experiment plan, metrics, pricing |

All execute **concurrently** via `subagent({tasks: [...], concurrency: N})`.
See `phases/context.md` for the full flow.

## 📋 Phase Index

> **Phase Status:** Read `references/pi-tools/phase-status.md` for ASCII status display and CLI commands.

Follow the sequence below. For phases 3-5 and 7, delegate to subskills via `/skill:`. Each subskill has its own **Reference Index** — load the skill to see it.

| # | Phase | Description | Trigger |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Project Setup** | Stages selection, safe-change | — |
| 2 | **Strategic Context** (optional) | Strategic exploration + domain detection | — |
| 3 | **Shape Up** | Create spec with problem/solution/scope | — |
| 4 | **Plan Critique** | Pre-flight check (LLM automatic) | — |
| 5 | **Review Gate (Plannotator)** | Visual approval — **never skip** | — |
| 6 | **Scope Adjustment** | Add/remove from IN/OUT (ask) | — |
| 7 | **Interface Brainstorming** | 5 proposals + hybrid (if selected) | — |
| 8 | **Interface Gate (Plannotator)** | Visual review of all interfaces | — |
| 9 | **Interface Selection** | User picks via ask with preview | — |
| 10 | **Tech Planning** | Typed scopes + sequencing | — |
| 11 | **Execution** | Goal/scope executor | — |

### AI-Aware Testing (Conditional)

**Phase 10 triggered:** When `product_type: software` or `product_type: hybrid`:

```
Tech Planning
    ↓
[product_type check]
    ↓ software/hybrid
cali-testing-ai-code → testing-strategy.md + test-* scopes
    ↓
Execution
```

See `skills-execution/cali-testing-ai-code/SKILL.md`

### Flow Diagram

```
Phase 1: Setup
    ↓
Phase 2: Strategic Context (optional)
    ↓
Phase 3: Shape Up
    ↓
Phase 4: Plan Critique (pre-flight)
    ↓
Phase 5: Plannotator Gate ← visual pause
    ↓
Phase 6: Scope Adjustment (ask)
    ↓
Phase 7: Interface Brainstorming (if selected)
    ↓
Phase 8: Plannotator Gate (interfaces) ← visual pause
    ↓
Phase 9: Interface Selection (ask with preview)
    ↓
Phase 10: Tech Planning
    ↓
Phase 11: Execution
```

### Auto-chaining rules

| User selection | Phases that run automatically |
|---|---|
| Shape Up only | Shape Up → Plan Critique → **Gate** → **Scope** → Tech Planning → **Execution** |
| Shape Up + Interface | Shape Up → Plan Critique → **Gate** → **Scope** → Interface → **Interface Gate** → Selection → Tech Planning → **Execution** |
| Tech Planning only | Tech Planning (with embedded Gate) → **Execution** |

**Plan Critique** runs automatically before every Gate.
**Gate** (Plannotator --gate) never skips — visual pause is mandatory.
**Scope Adjustment** happens after Gate approval, via ask (no Plannotator re-run).
**Interface Gate** shows all proposals visually before selection.
**Execution** runs automatically after Tech Planning — DO NOT ask user what to do next.

## ⚠️ Safety Rules

### Review Gate (Phase 5)
Use `references/pi-tools/plannotator.md` for Plannotator gate rules.

### Scope Adjustment (Phase 6)
- Use **Pattern 3** from `phases/ask-patterns.md`
- No Plannotator re-run after scope changes — ask tool confirms selections
- If adding items to IN, create new spec version (user is aware)
- If removing items, update spec in-place

### Interface Gate (Phase 8)
Use `references/pi-tools/plannotator.md` for Plannotator command.

### Interface Selection (Phase 9)
- Use **Pattern 2** from `phases/ask-patterns.md`

### Tech Planning (Phase 10)
- Before generating scopes: verify `approved: true` in spec-product.md
- **Deterministic** — do not rely on memory, read the YAML frontmatter
- **AI-Aware Testing**: If `product_type: software` or `product_type: hybrid` in frontmatter:
  - Activate `/skill:cali-testing-ai-code` to generate testing-strategy.md
  - Add `test-*` scope types to spec-tech.md
  - See `skills-execution/cali-testing-ai-code/SKILL.md`

### Supervisor (Phase 11)
- **Never activate during Phases 3-10.** The supervisor would re-submit Plannotator.
- Activate only during execution, WHEN STARTING each scope.

### Execution (Phase 11)
- **DO NOT ask** "Would you like to execute?", "Create /sisyphus?", "Review plan first?"
- **Execution is automatic** after Tech Planning approval. Proceed directly.
- Run `/skill:cali-product-scope-executor` for scope routing.
- See `phases/execution.md` for details.
- **DO NOT ask** "Would you like to execute?", "Create /sisyphus?", "Review plan first?"
- **Execution is automatic** after Tech Planning approval. Proceed directly.
- Run `/skill:cali-product-scope-executor` for scope routing.
- See `phases/execution.md` for details.

### Worktree
- Optional in Phase 11. Ask the user only if modifying code in shared repo AND parallel workflows exist.
- Single-scope workflows can skip worktree.
