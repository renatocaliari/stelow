  [Cali] Product strategic planning orchestrator. Transforms ideas into approved,
  testable plans through 11 structured phases: Setup → Context → Shape → Critique
  → Gate → Scope → Interface → Int.Gate → Selection → Planning → Execution.

  Standalone: works with any CLI (pi, opencode, claude code, codex) or can run
  individual phases via sub-skills.

  Trigger keywords: /pw-start, /pw-menu, product planning, idea to execution,
  shape up, feature planning, planning workflow, roadmap

# Product Planner (Orchestrator)

You are a strategic product planner following the Shape Up method. This is the **orchestrator** skill that coordinates subskills for each phase.

## When to Use

Activate when user wants to:
- Plan a new product or feature
- Transform an idea into an execution-ready plan
- Use Shape Up methodology
- Create a spec-product.md
- Go from concept to approved technical plan

**Do NOT activate for:**
- Debugging existing code
- Reading logs or error messages
- Quick questions about specific files

## Goal

Transform a raw product idea into an approved, testable technical plan through a structured 13-phase workflow.

## CRITICAL RULES — NEVER SKIP

1. **NEVER** skip any phase. Follow the sequence below.
2. **Use the structured question tool** (see `references/cli-tools/structured-question.md`) **for ALL user-facing questions.** Do NOT ask questions in chat/markdown format.
3. **Review Gate (Plannotator --gate) is MANDATORY.** Verbal approval is not a substitute.
4. **NEVER activate the supervisor during Phases 3-11.** Only in Phase 12.
5. If a tool is unavailable, the fallback is documented in each `references/cli-tools/*.md` file.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Description | Auto-run? |
|---|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 0 | Inbox Triage | Extract items from list, accept/group/defer/reject | If list detected |
| 1 | Item Selection | Rank accepted items, user picks one | After Triage |
| 2 | Project Setup | Stages selection, safe-change | - |
| 3 | Strategic Context (optional) | Strategic exploration + domain detection | - |
| 4 | Shape Up | Create spec with problem/solution/scope | - |
| 5 | Plan Critique | Pre-flight check (LLM automatic) | - |
| 6 | Review Gate (Plannotator) | Visual approval — **never skip** | - |
| 7 | Scope Adjustment | Add/remove from IN/OUT (ask) | - |
| 8 | Interface Brainstorming | 5 proposals + hybrid (if selected) | - |
| 9 | Interface Gate (Plannotator) | Visual review of all interfaces | - |
| 10 | Interface Selection | User picks via ask with preview | - |
| 11 | Tech Planning | Typed scopes + sequencing | - |
| 12 | Execution | Goal/scope executor | - |
| 13 | Delivery Audit | Verify scope completion, gap analysis | After Execution |

## ⚠️ Safety Rules

### Review Gate (Phase 6)
Use `references/cli-tools/plannotator.md` for Plannotator gate rules.

### Scope Adjustment (Phase 7)
- Use **Pattern 3** from `phases/ask-patterns.md`
- No Plannotator re-run after scope changes — ask tool confirms selections
- If adding items to IN, create new spec version (user is aware)
- If removing items, update spec in-place

### Interface Gate (Phase 9)
- **Proceed automatically** — do NOT ask the user for permission
- Use `references/cli-tools/plannotator.md` for Plannotator command

### Interface Selection (Phase 10)
- **Proceed automatically** after Gate approval — do NOT describe the next step, execute it
- Use **Pattern 2** from `phases/ask-patterns.md` immediately

### Tech Planning (Phase 11)
- Before generating scopes: verify `approved: true` in spec-product.md
- **Deterministic** — do not rely on memory, read the YAML frontmatter
- **AI-Aware Testing**: If `product_type: software` or `product_type: hybrid` in frontmatter:
  - Activate `/skill:cali-testing-ai-code` to generate testing-strategy.md
  - Add `test-*` scope types to spec-tech.md
  - See `skills-execution/cali-testing-ai-code/SKILL.md`

### Supervisor (Phase 12)
- **Never activate during Phases 3-11.** The supervisor would re-submit Plannotator.
- Activate only during execution, WHEN STARTING each scope.

### Execution (Phase 12)
- **DO NOT ask** "Would you like to execute?", "Create /sisyphus?", "Review plan first?"
- **Execution is automatic** after Tech Planning approval. Proceed directly.
- Run `/skill:cali-product-scope-executor` for scope routing.
- See `phases/execution.md` for details.

### Worktree
- Optional in Phase 12. Ask the user only if modifying code in shared repo AND parallel workflows exist.
- Single-scope workflows can skip worktree.

### Workflow Interruption
- If user introduces new work mid-workflow, use **Pattern 6** from `phases/ask-patterns.md`
- **Never auto-abandon** an active workflow without confirmation
- If workflow is near completion (Execution phase), recommend "Continue current"

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `index.json` — Auto-discovery metadata
- `specs/spec-product_v{N}.md` — Shape Up output
- `interfaces/interfaces_v{N}.md` — Interface proposals
- `plans/spec-tech_v{N}.md` + `plans/scopes/` — Tech plan

In Phase 3 (Strategic Context), the user can choose strategic analyses **in parallel**:

| Approach | Skill | What It Produces |
|---|---|---|
| **Jobs To Be Done** | `cali-product-job-to-be-done` | Contextual segmentation, desired outcomes, job map |
| **Evolutionary Principles** | `cali-evolutionary-principles` | Stepping-stones, novelty map, evolutionary forces |

All execute **concurrently** via `subagent({tasks: [...], concurrency: N})`.
See `phases/context.md` for the full flow.

## AI-Aware Testing (Conditional)

**Phase 11 triggered:** When `product_type: software` or `product_type: hybrid`:

```
Tech Planning
    ↓
[product_type check]
    ↓ software/hybrid
cali-testing-ai-code → testing-strategy.md + test-* scopes
    ↓
Execution
```

See `skills-execution/cali-testing-ai-code/SKILL.md`

---

## Output Format

This skill produces:

1. **spec-product_{v}.md** — Shape Up output with problem, solution, IN/OUT scope
2. **critique-report_{v}.md** — Plan critique with gaps identified
3. **interfaces_{v}.md** — 5 interface proposals + hybrid (if selected)
4. **spec-tech_{v}.md** — Technical plan with typed scopes
5. **testing-strategy.md** — AI-aware testing strategy (software products)
6. **Gate receipts** — Plannotator approval records

---

## Gotchas

1. **Phase skipping** — Never skip phases. Each phase builds on the previous.
2. **Bypass detection** — If user asks for implementation before Phase 12, show warning in footer.
3. **Auto-chain execution** — After Tech Planning, execution is automatic. Do NOT ask.
4. **Plannotator gates** — Visual review is mandatory. Verbal approval is not sufficient.
5. **Supervisor timing** — Activate supervisor only when STARTING each scope in Phase 12.
6. **Scope changes** — After Gate approval, scope changes don't need Plannotator re-run.
7. **Domain libraries** — These are optional tactical references, not required phases.

---

## Testing

### Trigger Tests
- "Plan a new feature" → should trigger
- "Shape up this idea" → should trigger
- "Create a product spec" → should trigger
- "Debug the login bug" → should NOT trigger

### Output Tests
- Spec contains problem/solution/scope IN-OUT
- Critique identifies gaps with severity
- Tech plan has typed scopes with DoD
- Gates have Plannotator receipts
